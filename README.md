### About the project

This is my portfolio project, built with Flutter Web, to showcase who I am, my skills, my professional experience, and the projects Iâ€™ve worked on. The website is fully responsive and features a clean, modern design. Youâ€™ll find sections about me, my technical skills, a timeline of my work experience, and highlights of my personal and freelance projects. Thereâ€™s also a contact section with my email, LinkedIn, and GitHub, plus options to download my CV in English or French. I created this site to make it easy for recruiters, collaborators, and anyone interested in my work to learn more about me and get in touch.
